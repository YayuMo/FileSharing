### 1.2 Classes of Computers

- Classes of Computers (p. 26)
  - Personal Mobile Device (PMD)
  - Desktop Computing
  - Servers
  - Clusters / Warehouse Scale Computers
  - Embedded Computers
- Parallelism (p. 29)
  - Class of parallelism in applications:
    - Data-Level Parallelism (DLP)
    - Task-Level Parallelism (TLP)
  - Class of architectural parallelism:
    - Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)
    - Vector architecture / Graphic Processor Units (GPUs)
    - Thread-Level Parallelism
    - Request-Level Parallelism
- Flynn's Taxonomy (p. 30)
  - Single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD)
  - Single instruciton stream, multiple data streams (SIMD)
  - Multiple instruction streams, multiple data streams (MIMD)

### 1.3 Defining Computer Architecture

- Typical Modern ISA's (p. 34)
  - General-purpose register architecture
  - Load-store classification
  - Byte addressing often used to access memory operands
- Instruction Classes (p. 35)
  - Data movement
    - move data between memory and/or registers, peripherals
  - Arithmetic / Logic
    - Arithmetic - add, multiply
    - Logic - and, or, not

### 1.6 Trends in Cost

- Dies per Wafer (p. 54)

  - $$
    \frac{Dies}{Wafer}=\frac{\pi(Diameter_{wafer}/2)^2}{Area_{die}}-\frac{\pi(Diameter_{wafer})}{\sqrt{2(Area_{die})}}
    $$

- Die Yield (p. 55)

  - $$
    Yiled_{die}=\frac{Yield_{wafter}}{[1+(defects/unitArea)(area_{die})]^N}
    $$

  - where N = process-complexity factor

- Effects on IC cost (p. 56)

  - $$
    cost_{die}=\frac{wafer_{cost}}{(dies/wafer)yield_{die}}
    $$

  - $$
    cost_{IC}=\frac{cost_{die}+cost_{testing\_die}+cost_{packaging\_and\_final\_test}}{yield_{final\_test}}
    $$

### 1.7 Dependability (p. 61)

- Module reliability

  - Mean time to failure (MTTF)
  - Mean time to repair (MTTR)
  - Mean time between failures (MTBF) = MTTF + MTTR
  - Availability = MTTF / MTBF

- Failures in Time (FIT)

  - Rate of failures per billion hours

  - $$
    MTTF = 10^9/FIT
    $$

### 1.8 Measuring, Reporting, and Summarizing Performance

- SPEC Benchmarks (p. 67)

  - Benchmark types
    - Open Systems
    - High Performance
    - Graphics

- Summarizing Performance Results (p. 69)

  - We want to compare 2 computers (A and B)

  - Run several different SPEC benchmarks on both computer A and B

  - For computer j, SPECRatio for a given benchmark is

    - $$
      SPECRatio_j=\frac{Exec\_Time_{ref}}{Exec\_Time_j}
      $$

    - where ref = a reference computer (baseline)

    - shorter exec time => larger SPECRatio

### 1.9 Quantitative Principle of Computer Design

- Take Advantage of Parallelism (p. 72)

  - System level - multiple processors
  - Processor level - pipelining

- Principle of Locality (p. 73)

  - Temporal Locality
  - Spatial Locality

- Amdahl's Law (p.76-78)

  - $$
    Speedup=\frac{Exec\_Time_{old}}{Exec\_Time_{new}} \\
    Exec\_Time_{new}=Exec\_Time_{old}[(1-F)+\frac{F}{Speedup_{Enhanced}}] \\
    Speedup=\frac{1}{(1-F)+\frac{F}{Speedup_{Enhanced}}}
    $$

  - Total original execution time T

  - Original components execution time E (E < T)

  - Fraction F = E/T

- Processor Performance Equation

  - Clock Cycle Time (p. 81)
    - CPU time = (clock cycles) / (clock rate)
    
  - CPI and Instruction Count
    - Instruction Count (IC) = number of instruction for a program
    - CPI = (clock cycles for a program) / IC
    - Thus, CPU time = (IC) (CPI) / (clock rate)
    
  - CPU Time $T_{exe}$ (p. 83)
  
    - $$
      T_{exe}=(IC)(CPI)(T_c)
      $$
    - IC = Instruction Count
  
      - \# of instructions in program being executed
    - CPI = Cycles Per Instruction
  
      - Average \# of cycles required to process each instruction 
    - $T_c$ = clock cycle time
  
      - Amount of time required to execute one clock cycle
  
  - Alternate Form (p. 84)
  
    - $$
      T_{exe}=(IC)(CPI)/(R_c)
      $$
  
    - IC = Instruction Count
  
      - \# of instructions in program being executed
  
    - CPI = Cycles Per Instruction
  
      - Average \# of cycles required to process each instruction
  
    - $R_c$ = clock rate
  
      - Cycles/sec (Hz)
      - Reciprocal of clock cycle time: $R_c=1/T_c$
